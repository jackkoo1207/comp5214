The model is not seen to be giving a correct output, and I believe it is because the checkpointing is not working. 

We can observe that after epoch48, the model is just predicting blank images (likely due to vanishing gradient I believe). However, since checkpointing is not working 
correctly, I could not load the model with the best val_loss (epoch 48). I have yet to fix this.

16Mar Update : Fixed the code as above and committed.
